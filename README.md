# AUTOMATED-WISH-SENDER
Project Title: Automated Wish Sender

Project Description:

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to create an automated system that sends wishes (such as birthday wishes, anniversary wishes, or holiday greetings) to recipients on specific dates or occasions without requiring manual intervention.

Key Features:

Recipient Database:
Users can maintain a database of recipients, including their names, email addresses, and important dates (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries).
Optionally, additional information such as preferences or interests can be stored to personalize the wishes.
Wish Scheduler:
Users can schedule wishes to be sent automatically on specific dates or occasions.
The system should support recurring schedules for wishes that need to be sent annually (e.g., birthday wishes).
Customizable Templates:
Users can create and customize wish templates for different occasions (e.g., birthday, anniversary, holiday).
Templates may include placeholders for dynamic content such as recipient names or specific messages.
Personalization:
The system can automatically personalize wishes by replacing placeholders in templates with recipient-specific information.
Personalization may extend to using recipient preferences or past interactions to tailor the content of wishes.
Multi-channel Support:
Wishes can be sent via multiple channels such as email, SMS, or social media platforms.
Users have the flexibility to choose the preferred channel for each recipient or occasion.
Feedback and Analytics:
Users can track the delivery status of wishes and view analytics on open rates or recipient engagement.
Feedback mechanisms allow recipients to respond to wishes or provide feedback, which can be useful for improving future messages.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Language: Python
Web Framework: Django or Flask for backend development
Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB for storing recipient data and wish templates
Email/SMS API: Integration with services like SendGrid, Twilio, or SMTP for sending messages
Deployment: Cloud hosting platforms like AWS or Heroku for hosting the application
Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome is an efficient and personalized automated wish sender system that relieves users from the burden of manually remembering and sending wishes, while maintaining a personal touch and fostering meaningful connections with recipients.

Challenges:

Ensuring timely and accurate delivery of wishes, especially across different time zones and communication channels.
Implementing robust error handling and notification mechanisms to handle failed deliveries or bounced messages.
Balancing automation with personalization to create authentic and heartfelt wishes that resonate with recipients.
Extensions:

Integration with calendar applications or social media platforms to automatically import important dates or events.
Adding support for rich media content (e.g., images, videos) in wishes to enhance engagement.
Incorporating sentiment analysis to automatically adjust the tone or style of wishes based on recipient mood or preferences.
Conclusion:
An automated wish sender system simplifies the process of sending wishes on special occasions, allowing users to stay connected with their friends, family, and colleagues with minimal effort. By leveraging technology to automate routine tasks, the system enables users to focus on fostering genuine relationships and making meaningful connections.

**REQUIREMENTS**
Python3

**REQUIRED MODULES**
1.SMTPLIB
2.PYWHATKIT

**SMALL INTRO ABOUT LIBRARIES**


The smtplib module defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon. For details of SMTP and ESMTP operation, consult RFC 821 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and RFC 1869 (SMTP Service Extensions).

class smtplib.SMTP(host='', port=0, local_hostname=None, [timeout, ]source_address=None)
An SMTP instance encapsulates an SMTP connection. It has methods that support a full repertoire of SMTP and ESMTP operations. If the optional host and port parameters are given, the SMTP connect() method is called with those parameters during initialization. If specified, local_hostname is used as the FQDN of the local host in the HELO/EHLO command. Otherwise, the local hostname is found using socket.getfqdn(). If the connect() call returns anything other than a success code, an SMTPConnectError is raised. The optional timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout setting will be used). If the timeout expires, TimeoutError is raised. The optional source_address parameter allows binding to some specific source address in a machine with multiple network interfaces, and/or to some specific source TCP port. It takes a 2-tuple (host, port), for the socket to bind to as its source address before connecting. If omitted (or if host or port are '' and/or 0 respectively) the OS default behavior will be used


**PYWHATKIT**
Python offers numerous inbuilt libraries to ease our work. Among them pywhatkit is a Python library for sending WhatsApp messages at a certain time, it has several other features too.

**PROJECT EXPLATION**
This project is mainly used for orgaisation which needs to send wishes for their employees by using datas imported from excel document
